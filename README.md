# Honours-Project
This is for my university honour's project: it is a web-based leaderboard and analytics platform for the Tetris.com competitive community.
Built with Python and Flask, it allows for tracking, analysing and displaying high scores and player profiles for the Tetris.com community.
Pre-selected moderators can upload verified scores, whilst players can view profiles, stats and performances through graphs.
Features include: Discord authentication for logging in, dynamic graphs and individual pages for players.
